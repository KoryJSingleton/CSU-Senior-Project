# Custom Keyboard Development for Refugee Language Accessibility

This project involves the design and implementation of custom mobile keyboards for Android and iOS that support a refugee community’s native alphabet. The keyboards enable users to read, write, and interact digitally in their own language, with a primary focus on supporting Bible translation efforts. The project emphasizes Unicode compliance, linguistic accuracy, usability, and cross-platform sustainability to ensure long-term accessibility and adoption.
